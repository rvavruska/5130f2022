Abstract: 

While IPv6 was invented 26 years ago, IPv4 still remains the more commonly used version of internet protocoling. With the growth of the internet however, the number of available addresses available to the world is dwindling day-by-day. With this, the need to swap standardizing IPv6 as the go-to addressing standard is becoming more and more needed. In this paper I will describe the implementation of IPv4 and IPv6 and discuss the benefits of each version as well as their shortcomings. The paper will primarily focus on why the internet is taking so long to switch to using IPv6, as today only about a third of the internet supports IPv6. It will also discuss the problem that IPv6 was trying to solve over IPv4, focusing as well on a performance comparison between the two versions. Through research it can be found that IPv6 is much better than IPv4 when it comes to performance, so why is IPv4 still more commonly used to this day?
