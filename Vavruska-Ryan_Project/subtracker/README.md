Summary

This project attempts to provide a free alternative to applications that track your active subscriptions. It provides a user registration and login mechanism, allowing users to add subscriptions to their account, as manage them, including deletion. It allows for users to select from a list of supported products, which provides officially presented instructions on how to unsubscribe from the services that are supported. If the user chooses other from the list of supported products and types in their own product name, they will instead be presented with a forum that will show instructions presented from other users that also have specified that same product name.
